This module, `swagger-ui-dist`, exposes Swagger-UI's entire dist folder as a dependency-free npm module. Use `swagger-ui` instead, if you'd like to have npm install dependencies for you.

`SwaggerUIBundle` and `SwaggerUIStandalonePreset` can be imported:
```javascript
  import { SwaggerUIBundle, SwaggerUIStandalonePreset } from 'swagger-ui-dist'
```

For anything else, check the [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) repository.
